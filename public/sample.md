# Getting Started with Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world's most popular markup languages.

## Basic Syntax

Here are some basic markdown syntax examples:

### Headers
```markdown
# H1
## H2
### H3
```

### Emphasis
```markdown
*italic* or _italic_
**bold** or __bold__
```

### Lists
```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2
```

### Links
```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
```

### Images
```markdown
![Alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

## Why Use Markdown?

1. **Portability**: Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application.
2. **Platform independence**: You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system.
3. **Future proof**: Even if the application you're using stops working at some point in the future, you'll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application.
